This is a SQL project created in my learning period of SQL to give myself a solid understanding not only of how to write Queries, and Sub-Queries, but also to practice write ups for Data Analysis based on the results. 
In the jobs_project_sql file you will find 5 SQL queries written to find answers to 5 questions related to the Data Analytics job market in 2023.
Utilizing SQL queries I was able to find the answers for the following.
What are the top paying data analyst jobs?
What skills are required for the top paying Data Analyst jobs?
What are the most in-demand skills for data analysts?
What are the top paying skills based on salary?
What are the most optimal skills to learn (aka high-demand and high-paying skill?)
Not only does this serve as a good way to practice the use of queries to solidify my knowledge in SQL, but it also gives me a bit of a guide to what skills and technologies to be learning.

TODO: Start the process of Data vizualization to grow my skills in vizualization and help add an easier to read representation for any perspective viewers.
